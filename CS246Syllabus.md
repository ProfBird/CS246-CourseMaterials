## Course Description 

In this course, students will learn to design and plan software systems development. Topics covered will include requirements gathering, design evaluation and documentation, and object-oriented program design. By the end of the course, students will have produced a design for a significant software project in a team environment. 

## Learning Outcomes 

The intent of this course is to enable you to design and plan significant software projects by identifying needs, creating user stories, and implementing those stories using project planning tools and appropriate software testing. 

## Course Content 

1. Developing software for a client
2. Agile project teams (user stories and backlog)

## Learning Resources 

### Texts

There is no required text for the course, but for students who would like to have reading material to supplement the in-class content, I recommend the following textbook: 

*Software Engineering: Theory and Practice: 4th Ed*., by Shari Pfleeger and Joanna Atlee. 

### Web Sites 

http://classes.lanecc.edu (LCCâ€™s Moodle site) will be used to host the web site for the course. The site is designed to provide you with all of the information you need about the content and structure of the course including: lecture notes, sample files, assignment descriptions and due dates, and announcements related to the course. 

### Assessment Activities 

The learning outcomes will be demonstrated by completing weekly assignments, in-class activities, and a final project which will serve as a design for your capstone project in the spring. Assignments will be 60% of your grade, in-class activities 10%, and the final project 30%. 

For the final project, you will be placed into groups of 3-5 students, which will also serve as your project groups for the capstone this spring. Groups will be assigned in week 6 with your input. 

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

|      | -        |         | +       |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A    | 90 - 91  | 92 - 97 | 98-100  |
| B    | 80 - 81  | 82 - 87 | 88 - 89 |
| C    | 70 - 71  | 72 - 77 | 78 - 79 |
| D    | 60 - 61  | 62 - 67 | 68 - 69 |
| F    | Below 60 |         |         |



#### Late Work

The grade for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

#### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must attend at least one class meeting.
