## Course Description 

In this course, students will learn to design and plan software systems development. Topics covered will include requirements gathering, design evaluation and documentation, and object-oriented program design. By the end of the course, students will have produced a design for a significant software project in a team environment. 

### Learning Outcomes 

The intent of this course is to enable you to design and plan significant software projects by identifying needs, creating user stories, and implementing those stories using project planning tools and appropriate software testing. 



## Learning Resources 

### Readings

There is no textbook for this course. Online reading will be assigned as the course progresses.

### Moodle 

http://classes.lanecc.edu (LCCâ€™s Moodle site) is the learning management system for the course. All of the information you need for the course will be provided via the Moodle course page: lecture notes, sample files, assignment descriptions and due dates, and announcements related to the course. 

### CIT Computer Lab

The CIT Main lab (Bldg. 19, room 135) is equipped with computers and software which are available exclusively for students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab work. The schedule for when the lab will be open and when in-person tutors are available is TBD.

#### Online Tutoring

See the [LCC Tutoring Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/tutor) web page for information.

## Assessment and Grading

The learning outcomes will be demonstrated by completing weekly assignments, in-class activities, and a term project which will serve as a design for your capstone project in the spring. 

| Activity                     | Percentage of grade |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Assignments                  | 50%                 |
| In-class / online activities | 10%                 |
| Term Project                 | 40%                 |

For the term project, you will be organized into groups of 3-5 students, which will also serve as your project groups for the capstone this spring. Groups will be assigned early in the term with your input. 

Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

|      | -        |         | +       |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A    | 90 - 91  | 92 - 97 | 98-100  |
| B    | 80 - 81  | 82 - 87 | 88 - 89 |
| C    | 70 - 71  | 72 - 77 | 78 - 79 |
| D    | 60 - 61  | 62 - 67 | 68 - 69 |
| F    | Below 60 |         |         |



### Late Work

The grade for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%.

### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must attend at least one class meeting, or complete one assignment or quiz.
