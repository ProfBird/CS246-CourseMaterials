# Final Presentation Guide

The purpose of the presentation is to show off your team's design and to tell us a little about the project you're doing for your client and your experience designing it. It will be interesting for everyone to see each other's designs!

Each team member should give one part of the presentation. Meet with your team ahead of time to plan who will present what.

The presentation should be about 8 to 12 minutes long. These are the things your should cover:

- Introduce your team
- Describe your client and the project you are doing for them.
- Show us your design documentation. Just point out the highlights, we don't need to see every detail (and there isn't time to show every detail!)
- Conclude by telling us what:
  - you are most proud of.
  - you think will be hardest to implement.
  - is the most important thing you learned.

## Updated Documentation

Update the documents you created for the design of your client's project. You will include this documentation in your presentation and submit it on Moodle.

This will be the "blueprint" you use when you build your web app in the capstone class. Update these documents with any additions or changes that came to light while checking UX diagrams and user stories with your client.

- Project Requirements

- Site Map

- UX Diagrams

- UML Diagram of the Domain Model

### How to Make Your Presentation

Your team can make the presentation one of three ways:

- In person: you will give a live presentation to the class. 
- On Zoom during class time: You will share your screen and the instructor will project that for the class to see.
- Online: You can record a video and post a link to it in the presentation forum on Moodle. If you are making a screen-cast you can use any screen capture software that both records the screen and audio narration such as:
  - [ScreenPal (formerly Screencast-O-Matic)](https://screenpal.com)&mdash;free for 15 minute or shorter screen-cast + web cam recordings.
  - [ScreenRec](https://screenrec.com/)&mdash;free!
  - [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com)&mdash;Meet with your team on Zoom, use webcams and/or mics, share your screen and record the meeting.

## Assessment

- Professionalism in both the presentation and the documents
- Completeness
- Quality of the things presented
- Each member's participation
