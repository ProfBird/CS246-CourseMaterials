# Final Presentation Guide

Your presentation should be no more than 15 minutes long. The times listed in the headings below are suggestions.

## Demonstration of your web site - 5 minutes

Suggested points:

- Show just the basic, core parts of the site and any parts that are new since the alpha presentation.
- Show any features you are especially proud of.
- Show any features that were especially hard to implement.

## Discussion of the Final Sprint

- Were you able to focus on just bug fixes and very minor changes?
- Did you learn anythiing in your last sprint that you wish you had known in your first sprint?
- How much was left in the product backlog? Was it all optional user stories?
- Is your client satisfied with the site you built for them?

## Evaluation of the finished product - 5 minutes

1. Assessment of the completeness of your application. 

   - Is the software done?

     (Does it do everything the client wants it to do?)

2. Assessment of the implementation of your system.

   - Will the code be easy to maintain?

     (Easy to: fix bugs and add new features).

   - To what degree did you follow "best practices" in coding? 

     (Separation of concerns, DRY code, no “dead” code, minimal dependencies, comments, descriptive names, etc.)

   - Do you have enough unit tests?

3. ~~Performance: will your code run fast?~~

   ~~(For example, will your database support a heavy load of users?)~~

4. How bug-free is your code?

   Possible points to address:

   - Has it been thoroughly tested?
   - Are there known bugs?
   - Does it crash unexpectedly, or does it do strange things at random times?
   - Do you have run-time exception handling?

5. Hosting

   - Where is the site hosted?
   - What do you like or dislike about the hosting service?
   - Will the client be able to maintain the site on this host?
