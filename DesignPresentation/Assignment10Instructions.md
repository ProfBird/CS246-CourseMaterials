# Final Design Documentation

## Assignment 10

### Instructions

Create a design document for your project. This will be the "blueprint" you use when you build your web app in the capstone class. This document will include updated elements from many of your previous documents. Your design document will include these sections:
- **Project overview**
  
  This will be an updated version of the overview in your project proposal. It will include a list of the features in the web app you have designed.
  
- **Entity model**
  
  Update the UML class diagram you already made for the model classes that will be used by Entity Framework. Include a short description that explains the key user stories that determined the relationships between classes.
  
- **Site Map**
  
  Use Balsamiq or another drawing program to make a site map that shows the navigation paths between each of the web pages.
  
- **UI Diagrams**
  
  Include a wire-frame or mock-up of each page in your web site. 
  
  - You can organize the diagrams in one of two ways. Use the one that makes sense for your site:
    - Organize the UI diagrams in sub-sections according to the list of features in the project overview. 
    - Organize the UI diagrams according to the navigational hierarchy in your site map.
  
  - Give each UI diagram a figure number and title. 
  - At the beginning of each sub-section give a short explanation of how the UI will work and how it implements the feature.
  - List the model objects used by each UI view.
  
- **Schedule**
  
  Make a list of sprints with a list of the features (from the list in the project overview) to be implemented in each sprint along with the beginning and end dates for each sprint. No new features should be implemented in the last sprint. It should just be for testing and bug fixing.
