### Where to find all my "product"  sites

This is under settings,  "manage my account", "product settings". It takes you to this URL

https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/products

#### For birdb@lanecc.edu

Here are the individual URLs associated with my birdb.lanecc.edu account.  
These URLs take you to the settings page for the product?team?project? Site.  
If you remove everything after the domain, you will get the Product?Team? site which lists the projects. For example: https://cs246-birdb.atlassian.net is the site with this project on it: https://cs246-birdb.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TPWS/boards/6
