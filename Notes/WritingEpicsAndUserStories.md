# Writing Epics and User Stories

Some good articles, but many of these elaborate on Epics in a way I didn't when I first presented them in class (no acceptance criteria, etc.)

[How to Write a Good User Story: with Examples & Templates](https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/) by Andrii Bondarenko at Stormotion. 

Good, in depth advice on writing user stories. Contains advertising for their mobile app dev services.

[User stories and epics for the win (with examples)](https://www.christianstrunk.com/blog/user-stories-and-epics-for-the-win)

Good explanations and examples. His Epics have a: title, introduction, goals & outcomes, success KPIs (measurements), notes, and open questions.



[How to Write User Stories (in Agile): The Three C’s and Examples](https://chisellabs.com/blog/how-to-write-agile-user-stories-three-cs-examples/)

Good, simple and basic explanations. The only thing added that we didn't present in class is acceptance criteria for user stories.

They advocate using actual paper cards.

They advise that user stories aren't enough, compliment them with other techniques like workflow diagrams, storyboards, mockups, or sketches. If you need to communicate an architectural element, then write a technical story. I (Brian) would add that some projects need a requirements document as well

[Epics vs. User Stories: what’s the difference?](https://www.delibr.com/post/epics-vs-user-stories-whats-the-difference#:~:text=In%20the%20world%20of%20agile%20software%20development%2C%20teams,about%20it%20in%20terms%20of%20rivers%20and%20streams.)

Great content and examples, but includes an Epic template that is much more elaborate than we used so far in class (our epics are just titles). Also includes a fair amount of advertising for deliber, the publisher of the article.
