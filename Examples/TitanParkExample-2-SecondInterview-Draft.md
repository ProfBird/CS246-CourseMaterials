## Second Interview

**Simulated Second Interview: Deep Dive into Challenges at Titan Park**

### Participants

 - **Emily Sanders:** Interim Director of Titan Park
 - **Mark Bradley:** Systems Analyst

**Mark:** Thanks for sitting down with me again, Emily. After our first conversation, I wanted to dive deeper into some of the challenges you mentioned, so I can ensure the system we design fully addresses your needs.

**Emily:** Of course, I’m happy to provide more details.

#### Challenge 1: Volunteer Recruitment

**Mark:** In our last meeting, you mentioned wanting an online volunteer application form. Can you tell me more about what fields you’d want to include in that form?

**Emily:** Sure. At a minimum, we’d need their full name, email, phone number, and mailing address. We’d also want to ask if they have any specific skills or certifications—like chainsaw training or first aid—that might be useful for certain projects.

**Mark:** That makes sense. Would you also want to collect availability?

**Emily:** Yes, definitely. A section where they can indicate the days of the week and times they’re usually available would be great.

**Mark:** How about preferences for types of projects?

**Emily:** Yes. We’d like a dropdown or checklist with options like trail maintenance, invasive species removal, planting natives, nursery work, and event support.

#### Challenge 2: Volunteer Scheduling

**Mark:** Let’s talk more about scheduling. Right now, you’re using spreadsheets to manage volunteer shifts. How detailed does the schedule need to be?

**Emily:** It depends on the project. For something like trail maintenance, we might schedule volunteers for specific time slots—say, 9 a.m. to noon on a Saturday. But for the native plant nursery, it’s more flexible. Volunteers can drop in during open hours, so we just need a way to track how many people are planning to come on a given day.

**Mark:** So, the system would need to handle both fixed and flexible schedules?

**Emily:** Exactly. And it would be great if volunteers could see how many slots are still open for a given project so we can avoid overcrowding or understaffing.

#### Challenge 3: Volunteer Data Management

**Mark:** In terms of managing volunteer data, how do you currently track project participation?

**Emily:** We try to log hours manually after each project, but it’s not consistent. Ideally, the system could automatically track hours when volunteers check in and out or when they’re scheduled for a shift.

**Mark:** Would you want to generate reports based on those hours?

**Emily:** Yes, absolutely. We’d like to be able to recognize volunteers who reach certain milestones, like 50 or 100 hours. Those reports would also help us demonstrate our impact when we apply for grants.

**Mark:** Good point. Would you need any other details tied to volunteer records?

**Emily:** We’d like to track who’s completed specific training. For example, volunteers working with power tools need to attend a safety workshop, and we need to know who’s certified.

#### Challenge 4: Event and Project Promotion

**Mark:** For event and project promotion, you mentioned using your website and social media. How do you currently update your website?

**Emily:** Our website is managed through a content management system, but updates are manual. For example, when we have a new volunteer event, we have to create the event page and manually link to a signup form.

**Mark:** Would you prefer a system where events and volunteer opportunities automatically sync to the website?

**Emily:** That would be ideal. If we could create an event or project in the system and have it automatically generate a public-facing page with details and signup links, it would save us a lot of time.

**Mark:** Do you also want to include project updates or progress reports on the website?

**Emily:** Yes, that’s a great idea. Sharing updates about what we’ve accomplished could help engage the community and attract more volunteers.

#### Challenge 5: Fundraising and Support

**Mark:** Last time, you mentioned that many of your volunteers also become members or donors. How do you currently manage those relationships?

**Emily:** It’s very ad hoc. We send out a quarterly email asking volunteers to consider becoming members, but it’s not personalized.

**Mark:** Would it help to integrate your volunteer database with your fundraising system?

**Emily:** Definitely. If we could see who’s volunteered recently and send targeted emails thanking them for their work and suggesting ways to support us financially, that would be very effective.

**Mark:** Would you want to track which volunteers are already members or donors?

**Emily:** Yes, that would be useful. We could tailor our outreach to encourage them to increase their support or renew their membership.

#### Challenge 6: Administrative Tools

**Mark:** For the admin pages we discussed, how many staff members would need access to the system?

**Emily:** Probably five or six people. Each staff member manages different projects, so we’d need a way to assign access based on their roles. For example, the nursery manager doesn’t need to see trail maintenance schedules.

**Mark:** Understood. Would you also need audit logs to track changes, like who updated a volunteer record or modified a schedule?

**Emily:** That would be helpful, especially as we bring on new staff.

**Next Steps**

**Mark:** Thanks for all this additional information, Emily. It’s clear that the system needs to be flexible and user-friendly for both volunteers and staff. I’ll refine the requirements document based on this conversation.

**Emily:** Thank you, Mark. I’m excited to see what you come up with. Let me know if you need anything else.

**Mark:** Will do. I’ll be in touch soon.
