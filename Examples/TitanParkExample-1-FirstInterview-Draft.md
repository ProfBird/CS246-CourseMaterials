## First Interview

**Case Study: Enhancing Volunteer Management for Titan Park**

### Participants

- **Executive Director:** Emily Sanders, Interim Director of Titan Park
- **Systems Analyst:** Mark Bradley

### Simulated Interview Transcript

**Mark:** Thanks for meeting with me, Emily. Can you start by giving me an overview of the Titan Park?

**Emily:** Absolutely. We’re a non-profit organization focused on protecting and enhancing the ecosystems around Mt. Pisgah while supporting compatible recreation. We manage projects like trail maintenance, removing invasive species, and running a native plant nursery. We also host events and rely heavily on volunteers, donations, and community support to fulfill our mission.

**Mark:** That’s impressive. I understand you’re looking to improve how you manage volunteers. Could you explain your current challenges?

#### Challenge 1: Volunteer Recruitment

**Emily:** Sure. One of our biggest challenges is recruiting volunteers. Right now, we rely on word of mouth, social media, and occasional email campaigns to reach potential volunteers. It works to an extent, but we don’t have a centralized way to gather applications or match people with projects based on their interests.

**Mark:** So, a system that includes an online volunteer application form would help?

**Emily:** Definitely. If potential volunteers could fill out a form on our website, providing their contact information and the types of projects they’re interested in, it would save us a lot of back-and-forth communication.

#### Challenge 2: Volunteer Scheduling

**Mark:** Once someone signs up to volunteer, how do you handle scheduling?

**Emily:** Right now, it’s all manual. We maintain spreadsheets for each project and email or call volunteers to coordinate schedules. It’s time-consuming, and it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.

**Mark:** I can see how that could be frustrating. Would an online scheduling system where volunteers can see available times and sign up for specific slots be useful?

**Emily:** Yes, that would be amazing! It would allow volunteers to take more ownership of their schedules and reduce the administrative burden on our staff.

#### Challenge 3: Volunteer Data Management

**Mark:** How do you keep track of your volunteers and their contributions?

**Emily:** We have a basic database, but it’s outdated and not very user-friendly. It doesn’t integrate well with our website, so we often end up managing information across multiple systems. We need a way to centralize volunteer data, like contact information, project involvement, and schedules, in one place.

**Mark:** Would you also want administrative tools for staff to manage this data?

**Emily:** Absolutely. If we could access a database of volunteers and projects through a secure admin page, it would make our operations much smoother.

#### Challenge 4: Promoting Events and Projects

**Mark:** You also mentioned promoting events. How do you currently handle that?

**Emily:** Mostly through our website, social media, and email newsletters. It works, but it’s time-consuming to update everything manually. If we could integrate volunteer scheduling and project information into our event promotions, that would be a big help.

**Mark:** So, a system that dynamically updates project availability on the website and includes promotion tools would be ideal?

**Emily:** Exactly. The more streamlined, the better.

#### Challenge 5: Fundraising and Support

**Mark:** One last question—how does volunteer engagement tie into your fundraising efforts?

**Emily:** Our volunteers are also some of our most loyal supporters. Many of them become members, make donations, or encourage their employers to sponsor us. Having a better system to engage and track volunteers would help us strengthen those relationships and potentially grow our funding base.

### Proposed Solutions

**Mark:** Based on what you’ve shared, here’s what I think we need:

​	1.	**Online Volunteer Application Form**

​	•	Collect contact information.

​	•	Allow volunteers to select projects of interest from a dynamically generated list.

​	2.	**Online Volunteer Scheduling System**

​	•	Display available times for work on various projects.

​	•	Allow volunteers to sign up for specific time slots.

​	3.	**Administrative Tools**

​	•	A secure database for staff to manage volunteer information, including contact details, project involvement, and schedules.

​	•	A database for managing and updating project details.

​	4.	**Event and Project Promotion Integration**

​	•	Dynamically display project schedules and volunteer opportunities on the website.

​	•	Enable easy updates to event and project information.

​	5.	**Future Expansion**

​	•	Integrate volunteer engagement data with fundraising tools to better track and engage supporters.

**Emily:** That all sounds perfect. How long do you think implementation would take?

**Mark:** With the right tools and a phased approach, we could have the core volunteer management features up and running in about three to four months.

**Emily:** That’s great. Let’s get started!
