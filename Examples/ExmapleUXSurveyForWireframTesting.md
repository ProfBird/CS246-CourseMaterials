### Example UX Survey for Web Site UI Diagram Testing

**CS 246: System Design**

This is a general list of questions for early testing of UI design using diagrams (sketches, wire-frames, or mockups). You can use these questions as an inspiration for your own, or start with these and add, remove or modify the questions to fit your particular UI design.

#### General Impressions

1. **Clarity of Purpose**: Does each web pageâ€™s purpose seem clear from the wire-frame?
2. **Consistency**: Are design elements (e.g., navigation, buttons, headings) consistent across the web pages?
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Does each web page effectively highlight the most important elements on the page?
4. **First Impressions**: How would you describe your first impression of the page(s)?

#### Navigation and Layout

1. **Navigation Clarity**: Is it easy to understand how to navigate between different pages or sections?
2. **Intuitive Layout:** How easy was it to find the information you were looking for within the pages?

#### Content and Labeling

1. **Button Labels**: Are button labels clear and descriptive of their function?
2. **Headings and Titles**: Are headings and titles appropriately descriptive?
3. **Call-to-Action**: Are calls-to-action (e.g., "Sign Up," "Learn More") prominent and clear?

#### Functionality

1. **Interactivity**: Is the purpose of interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons) clear from the design?
2. **Error Prevention**: Are there any elements that could potentially confuse users or lead to errors?

#### Overall Feedback

1. **Strengths**: What do you think are the strengths of these web page designs?
2. **Improvements**: What areas do you think need improvement?
