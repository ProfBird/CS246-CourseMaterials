## Requirements Document

1. **Requirements Document for the Volunteer Management System at Titan Park**

   

   **1. Introduction**

   

   **1.1 Purpose**

   

   This document outlines the requirements for a Volunteer Management System (VMS) designed to support the operations of Titan Park. The system aims to enhance volunteer recruitment, scheduling, data management, and project/event promotion, ultimately increasing efficiency and engagement.

   

   **1.2 Background**

   

   Titan Park is a non-profit organization focused on protecting native ecosystems and promoting compatible recreation. The organization relies heavily on volunteers for projects such as trail maintenance, invasive species removal, native plant nursery operations, and event support. Current manual processes for volunteer management are time-consuming and error-prone.

   

   **2. System Overview**

   

   The proposed VMS will include the following core functionalities:

   ​	1.	Online Volunteer Application Form

   ​	2.	Volunteer Scheduling System

   ​	3.	Volunteer and Project Data Management Tools

   ​	4.	Event and Project Promotion Integration

   ​	5.	Administrative Tools for Staff

   

   **3. Functional Requirements**

   

   **3.1 Online Volunteer Application Form**

   

   The system will provide an online form for potential volunteers to apply, capturing:

   ​	•	**Contact Information**: Name, email, phone number, and mailing address.

   ​	•	**Skills and Certifications**: A checklist or free-text field for specific skills (e.g., chainsaw training, first aid).

   ​	•	**Availability**: Days of the week and times the volunteer is available.

   ​	•	**Project Preferences**: A dynamically generated list of projects (e.g., trail maintenance, nursery work) for selection.

   

   **3.2 Volunteer Scheduling System**

   ​	•	**Flexible Scheduling**:

   ​	•	Fixed shifts for projects like trail maintenance (e.g., 9 a.m. to noon slots).

   ​	•	Open hours for projects like nursery work, allowing volunteers to indicate attendance without time slots.

   ​	•	**Availability Display**:

   ​	•	Show available slots and prevent over-scheduling or understaffing.

   ​	•	**Self-Check-In/Out**:

   ​	•	Volunteers can log their attendance for tracking purposes.

   ​	•	**Notifications**:

   ​	•	Send automated reminders for upcoming shifts or schedule changes.

   

   **3.3 Volunteer and Project Data Management Tools**

   ​	•	**Volunteer Database**:

   ​	•	Centralized records with contact details, project involvement, availability, hours logged, and certifications.

   ​	•	Track volunteer milestones (e.g., total hours worked).

   ​	•	**Project Database**:

   ​	•	Maintain project details such as description, required skills, schedules, and staffing levels.

   ​	•	**Reporting**:

   ​	•	Generate reports on volunteer hours, project progress, and milestones for internal use or grant applications.

   

   **3.4 Event and Project Promotion Integration**

   ​	•	**Dynamic Updates**:

   ​	•	Automatically generate public-facing pages for new projects and events based on the system’s data.

   ​	•	**Volunteer Opportunities**:

   ​	•	List open volunteer opportunities with real-time availability.

   ​	•	**Progress Updates**:

   ​	•	Allow staff to share project milestones and accomplishments on the website to engage the community.

   

   **3.5 Administrative Tools for Staff**

   ​	•	**Role-Based Access**:

   ​	•	Assign permissions based on staff roles (e.g., nursery manager, trail coordinator).

   ​	•	**Audit Logs**:

   ​	•	Track changes made to volunteer records, schedules, or project data.

   ​	•	**Communication Tools**:

   ​	•	Send targeted messages to volunteers, such as thank-you notes or specific project updates.

   ​	•	**Fundraising Integration**:

   ​	•	Link volunteer activity to membership and donation data for tailored outreach.

   

   **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

   

   **4.1 Usability**

   ​	•	Intuitive interfaces for volunteers and staff.

   ​	•	Mobile-friendly design to support on-the-go use.

   

   **4.2 Performance**

   ​	•	Handle up to 500 concurrent users during peak times, such as event registration.

   ​	•	Update schedules and databases in real-time, with a response time under 2 seconds.

   

   **4.3 Scalability**

   ​	•	Accommodate growing volunteer numbers and new project types as the organization expands.

   

   **4.4 Reliability**

   ​	•	Ensure 99.9% system uptime.

   ​	•	Perform automated daily backups to prevent data loss.

   

   **4.5 Security**

   ​	•	Protect volunteer and staff data with encryption and secure user authentication.
