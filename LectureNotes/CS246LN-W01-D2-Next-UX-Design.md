## UX Design Tools

Next week you will be doing UX design for the same web site you made your Jira backlog for.  
You will have a choice of the tools you use as a team to create wireframe diagrams of your web pages. The two software tools I reccomend are:

- [BalsaImiq](https://balsamiq.com/)&mdash;A rapid wire-framing tool that reproduces the experience of sketching on a whiteboard.
  - Both desktop and web based versions are available.
    - Desktop version: runs on Windows and Mac OS.
    - Cloud version: runs in any browser and integrates with Google Drive.
  - Mainly used to create "lo-fidelity" wireframes as opposed to "hi-fidelity" UI designs.  
    This tool is mainly used by *developers* rather than *designers*.
  - Wireframes can be connected together as working prototypes.
  - I have requested a free cloud account for everyone in the class.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)&mdash; A collaborative web application for interface and UX design.
  - Both web based and desktop versions are available (Windows and Mac OS).
  - Can be used by both *developers* and by *designers*
  - Facilitates the full design process from brainstorming and wireframes through finished designs.
  - [Free, full-featured, academic accounts](https://figma.com/education/apply) are available, limited free accounts available for others.
  - Can be used to generate actual user interfaces.

I recommend that as a team you decide on one of these tools and do the tutorials so will know how to use it when you start on the next lab assignment during the next class.
