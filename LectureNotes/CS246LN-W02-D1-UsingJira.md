### How do I find links to my Jira sites ?

When you signed up for your Jira account, you were asked for a name for a site. This is the address you will go to to view and manage the projects you own. This also creates an organization.

When you are added to a project that is on a site owned by someone else, that site will be added to those you can access.

You can see links to all your Atlassian sites, including Jira sites, by logging into your [Atlassian account](https://www.atlassian.com/), clicking on the account button in the upper-right corner of the page.

### How do I view my Organizations

Go to the [Atlassian Admin](https://admin.atlassian.com/) page and log in. You will see your organizations and be able to select one that you want to manage.
