# User eXperience Testing

## Overview of UX Testing

Getting user feedback early and often is at the heart of any Agile development process!

- What is the difference between usability testing and functional testing?

- Types of usability testing:

- - Individual testers
  - Focus groups

- Means of getting feedback

- - Surveys
  - Interviews
  - Recordings of testers- audio and/or video
  - Instrumenting the code (for alpha and beta testing)

- What to test

- - Sketches (even on a napkin!)
  - Wire-frames
    
  - Mock-ups
  - Prototypes
  - Real code

​        

## My experience at Intel with focus groups

These are some of the things my development group (Intel Architecture Labs) and I did:
      

- Built mock-ups and prototypes

- Wrote a test script
            (Prototypes had "canned" responses, so following a test script was essential).

- Observed focus group sessions

  - Three or four people were in each focus group. 
        They were selected and paid by a professional agency.
  - Participants were in a room with a computer and a moderator. 
    - Observers were in another room watching through a one-way mirror. 
    - We had video cameras recording the participants.

  - A professional moderator read the script. 
    - This helps avoid the problem of participants not wanting to hurt the developers' feelings and of the developer grimacing and looking hurt in front of the participants.

    - The participants didn't touch the computer; they just watched and answered questions.


  - We developers all watched the videos afterward and discussed the participants' responses.
              

## Rocket Surgery made easy approach

- It's a minimum, for Agile, to do UX testing at the end of every sprint.

- Start earlier than you think makes sense.
  - Show participants (testers) anything from sketches to working code.
  - The earlier you start, the less you'll have to change.

- Recruit from a wide pool.
  - Getting people who are like your "target audience" is a nice goal, but don't be too strict about it.
  - Don't use the same group of testers twice (unless all they saw were sketches)--if you can.
              

- Make it a spectator sport (about the observers)
  - The eureka moment: the users aren't all like me!
  - Watching live is more impactful than watching a recording.
  - Get the whole development team to watch - even the project sponsors
           (but having them in another room is less intimidating to the participants).
  - Give them instructions (what to watch for).
  - Be ready for criticism, take it as constructive and helpful.
  - Provide food (snacks).

- Focus ruthlessly on a small number of the most important problems.

- Hold a debriefing and produce:
  - A list of the most serious problems
  - A list (smaller) of what you will fix before the next test
  - More food (lunch)

- When fixing problems, always do the least you can do
  - "What's the smallest, simplest change we can make that's likely to keep people from having the problem we observed?"
  - "The perfect is the enemy of the good"
           (Opposite of the "good is the enemy of the best")
  - Taking something away is sometimes better than adding something.
  - Avoid redesign unless it's really necessary
  - Only re-test major changes, not tweaks
