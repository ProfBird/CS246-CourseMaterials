# Course Overview

**CS246N System Design**

[TOC]

## Purpose of this course

The first in a two-course sequence in which you will work with a team to first design, then implement a significant software project. This is the design course and next term you will implement the design in the Capstone course, CS297.

**Both Programming students and Game Dev students in the class**

Since Paul Wilkins has moved on to a job in industry, his section of 246 has been added to mine. I'm not an expert on game design, but there are general concepts of software design that will apply to game design as well.

- I've put students into groups. Look at your group on Moodle and make sure you are in the right kind of group.  Let me know if you are on the Game Dev Art track. There are:
  - Programming groups
  - Game Dev groups
