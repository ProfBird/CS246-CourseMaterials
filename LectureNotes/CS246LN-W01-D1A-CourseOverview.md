## Purpose of this course

This is the first in a two-course sequence in which you will work with a team to design, then implement a significant software project. This is the design course and next term you will implement the design in the Capstone course, CS 297.

**Group Work**

All of the lab assignments in this class will be group assignments. I will put students into groups during the first week of the class.

    - Your self-selected capstone project team for the last six weeks.



## Capstone project

You will start your capstone project in <u>week five</u> of this course. Start brainstorming ideas for a project now by looking for a client out there in the real world that you can develop a web site for.

### Finding a Project Client

You will do your capstone project for a "real world" client. You should start looking for a client this week. Teams in the past have done web sites for local businesses, non-profit organizations, schools, churches, stores, restaurants, political campaigns, and others.

Teams have found clients in a variety of ways: 

- Talk to family or friends about businesses or organizations they are involved with.

- Post an ad on Craig's List, [Eugene Switchboard](https://eugenetech.switchboardhq.com/stories), or other online medium.
- Talk to a local business or organization that you frequent (store, restaurant, club).
- Do a web stie for your employer.

#### What's Expected of the Client

The client will need to be willing to meet with your team once a week from weeks 5 through 10 of this class (five meetings) and every-other week during the capstone class next term (five more meetings). The meetings can be in-person or online (Zoom, Discord, etc.)

**You will need to have found a client by week 4 and have scheduled your first meeting with them for sometime during week 5.**
