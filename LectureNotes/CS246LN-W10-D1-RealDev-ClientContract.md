## Introduction

This week, you will be writing a software development  contract for your client.

The contract will include  a description of the project and an estimage of the effort required to complete it. The contract also includes some legal language that will ensure that you and your client understand what to expect from each other.

## Example Contract

## Selective Explanation of Contract details

### Deployment

- You can either deploy your web site on one of your free Azure for Students accounts, or on the hosting service that your client will use after you finish the project. (Your client won't be able to use your free Azure account.)
- A couple good, low cost, hosting services for small to medium traffic web sites are [WinHost](https://winhost.com)Â and [SmarterASP.NET](https://www.smarterasp.net/index?r=profbird).

### Estimate

- In the example, there are two estimates&mdash;one for a minimal implementation and one for a full iimplementation of the web site. You don't need to do that in your proposal unless it makes sense for your client.

- Next term, when you implement this project, you will have 10 weeks and 10 hours per week, per team member available for development. Your estimate should be well below the sum total of hours your team has available.

   For example, if you have a team with three members, you will have 300 hours of development time available. If you estimate that your project will take 150 hours, then it's probably the right size project because things always take longer than you think&mdash;<u>two or three time as long</u>. So if you think it will take 150 hours, then double all the estimated times in your proposal and that will probably be realistic!

### Cost Estimate and Payment Terms

You don't really need this paragraph since you won't be charging your client anything. The only thing you might list here is the cost of a hosting service, if you will be deploying to a service that is not free.

### Intellectual property

Normally, when you as a developer develop software for a client, whether you work for a company or are a free-lancer, the client is paying for the rights to the IP of the software you are developing. But there are other options, including making the software open source or sharing the IP.

### Indemnification

Normally this clause only indemnifies the client from any actions taken by the developer that might be cause for litigation against the client. In particular, in the case the developer is accused of infringing on the IP of a third party. I have broadened this clause to provide indemnification for both the client and developer.
