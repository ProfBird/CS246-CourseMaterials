# Problem Solving

**CS246N System Design**

[TOC]

## Software is Written to Solve Problems

For software to be useful and to be adopted by users, it needs to satisfy some need.

### Types of solutions

- Provide new tools and new ways to do things: spreadsheets, Learning Management Systems, Project management (MS Project, Jira, Trello)
- Automate business processes: automated manufacturing, self-serve banking

- Improve communication and relationships: e-mail, text messages, online meetings (Zoom), group communication (Discord, Teams), social media
- Provide entertainment: streaming movies, computer games, podcasts
- More

### How to come up with solutions

#### Look at someone else's solution to a similar problem

Example problem: A new food delivery service is having trouble scheduling it's deliveries.

- Look at how Uber and Lyft schedule drivers
- Look at how UPS or FedEx schedule deliveries

#### Turn a manual solution into a computer based solution

Example problem: A farmer spends a lot of time going around his fields turning on and off sprinklers and other irrigation systems based on the growing season, weather and dryness of the soil.

- Use a computer based system to control irrigation valves according to a schedule.
  - Add a feature to measure soil moisture for added control.
  - Add a feature to adapt the schedule to the weather.

#### Come up with a novel solution

Use your imagination to dream up a solution you haven't seen before.

Example problem: people get too many e-mails in their in-boxes

- Write a program that uses machine learning to sort mail into categories

  - Users train the system by dragging mail into folders they define

    - Personal
    - News
    - Business

  - The software learns to recognize these types of e-mails and puts them in the right folder.

    

### How to identify problems

A problem may not be something that is currently seen as a problem or a need. It might just be something that can be improved. 
Example: before the smart phone became a thing, how many people thought that there was a problem with their mobile phone?

Here are things to look for:

- A process that takes a long time to complete
- A process that is prone to mistakes
- A situation where communication is lacking
- A situation where data is hard to access
- Something that isn't fun
- And more



## Lab Assignment

This assignment is oriented toward web developers, but game developers can adapt it by looking at a gaming web site (I'd prefer something that's online and free so that I can look at it.)
