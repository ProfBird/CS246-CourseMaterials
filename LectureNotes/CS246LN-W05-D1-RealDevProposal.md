## Introduction

This week, you will be writing a software development proposal and contract for your client. Note that *both of these need to be approved by your instructor before sending them to your client*.

## Software Development Proposal

This will be more formal than the practice proposal you wrote at the beginning of the term. The example proposal below is a modified version of an actual proposal that my software development company made a few years ago.

### Example Proposal

[**Software Development Proposal for HAO**](CS246-ProjectProposalExample-ConferenceApp.pdf)

The proposal includes a cover letter and a proposal document. The HAO and HAA and all names in the document are fictional.

#### Selective Explanation of Proposal details

- **Deployment** 

  - You can either deploy your web site on one of your free Azure for Students accounts, or on the hosting service that your client will use after you finish the project. (Your client  won't be able to use your free Azure account.)
  - A good, low cost, hosting service for small to medium traffic web sites is [WinHost](https://winhost.com).

- **Estimate** 

  - In the example, there are two estimates&mdash;one for a minimal implementation and one for a full iimplementation of the web site. You don't need to do that in your proposal unless it makes sense for your client.

  - Next term, when you implement this project, you will have 10 weeks and  10 hours per week, per team member available for development. You estimate should be well below the sum total of hours your team has available.

     For example, if you have a team with three members, you will have 300 hours of development time available. If you estimate that your project will take 150 hours, then it's probably the right size project because things always take longer than you think&mdash;two or three time as long. So if you think it will take 150 hours, then double all your estimated times and that will probably be realistic!

- **Cost Estimate and Payment Terms** 

  You don't really need this paragraph since you won't be charging your client anything. The only thing you might list here is the cost of a hosting service, if you will be deploying to a service that is not free.

  

## Software Development Contract

The contract will include the final version of your revised and approved proposal. The contract also includes some legal language that will ensure that you and your client understand what to expect from each other.

### Example Contract

[[**Software Development Contract with HAO**](CS246-ContractExample-ConferenceApp.pdf)]

The contract includes a revised version of the proposal, with the agreed upon list of features and estimate, as well as a legal contract to be signed by the developer(s) and the client.

#### Selective Explanation of Contract details

- **Intellectual property**
  
  Normally, when you as a developer develop software for a client, whether you are a company or a free-lancer, the client is paying for the rights to the IP of the software you are developing. But there are other options, including making the software open source or sharing the IP.
  
- **Indemnification**
  
  Normally this clause only indemnifies the client from any actions taken by the developer that might be cause for litigation against the client. In particular, in the case the developer is accused of infringing on the IP of a third party. I have broadened this clause to provide indemnification for both the client and developer.
