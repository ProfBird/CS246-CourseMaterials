### Example of a Software Development Proposal

[**Software Development Proposal for HAO**](CS246-ProjectProposalExample-ConferenceApp.pdf)

The proposal includes a cover letter and a proposal document. The HAO and HAA and all names in the document are fictional.

### Example of a Software Development Contract

[[**Software Development Contract with HAO**](CS246-ContractExample-ConferenceApp.pdf)]

The contract includes a revised version of the proposal, with the agreed upon list of features and estimate, as well as a legal contract to be signed by the developer(s) and the client.

#### Contract details

- **Intellectual property**
  Normally, when you as a developer develop software for a client, whether you are a company or a free-lancer, the client is paying for the rights to the IP of the software you are developing. But there are other options, including making the software open source or sharing the IP.

- **Indemnification**
  Normally this clause only indemnifies the client from any actions taken by the developer that might be cause for litigation against the client. In particular, in the case the developer is accused of infringing on the IP of a third party. I have broadened this clause to provide indemnification for both the client and developer.
