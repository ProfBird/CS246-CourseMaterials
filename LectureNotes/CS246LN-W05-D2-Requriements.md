## Going from Requirements to a Product

A software project will often be started when a *Business Analyst* develops a *Business Case* and/or  *Business Requirements*. 

A *Systems Analyst* will then develop *System or Software Requirements Specification* (SRS) using the Business Requirements as a starting point. 

*Software Architects/Engineers* will then design the system and/or software based on the SRS.

*Software Developers* will implement the software.

This process will often be followed even when the development team is using an Agile approach.

In small or mid-sized companies all of these functions might be done by software develpers or engineers.

### Business Requirements

*Business requirements* are the business problems or needs that a software product will be a solution for.  They include goals and objectives, stakeholder needs, functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and use cases. 

### Software Requirements

*Software requirements* refer to detailed descriptions of the functionalities, features, and constraints of a software system. They encompass both *functional requirements*, which specify what the software should do (e.g., tasks, services, and functions), and *non-functional requirements*, which outline the system's quality attributes and performance criteria (e.g., security, reliability, scalability, and usability). These requirements are based on the *business requirements* for this software solution.

## Requirements Documentation in This Course

In this course you are writing a requirements document that merges business requirements and software requirements. You are further documenting the requirements with user stories. You are making UX diagrams to further refine the software requireemnts as well as to start the design of the software solution.
