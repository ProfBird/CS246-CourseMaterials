## What is UX?

User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a software system. The system could be a website, a web application or desktop software.

### Origin of the term UX

UX is relatively new. The term “user experience” was coined in 1993 by Dr. Donald Norman, a cognitive science researcher who was also the first to describe the importance of user-centered design (the notion that design decisions should be based on the needs and wants of users).

### Universal Access

Universal access means designing our web sites for those who have special requirements, such as for screen readers and non-traditional input devices, as well as for those who don’t have broadband connections or who have older mobile devices.

## What Do UX Designers Do?

UX designers study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, and efficiency in performing tasks.

For example, they might study the checkout process of an online store to see whether users find the process of buying products from the website easy and pleasant. They could delve deeper by seeing how efficient and pleasant it is for users to fill out input fields in a Web form.

### How they do it

These are some of the tasks UX designers perform:

#### Evaluation of a current system

If a system already exists, they will evaluate its current state. They will report issues and suggest fixes based on their analysis.

#### A/B testing

They devise a studies to compare the user's experience with two or more different user interfaces.


This is done by stating a hypothesis (e.g. “A green button is more attractive than a red button.”), proposing or creating multiple versions of a design, defining what a “better experience” means (e.g. “The green button is better because users clicked it more.”) and then conducting the test.

#### User surveys

They interview existing and potential users of the system to gain insight into what would be the most effective design. 

#### Wireframes and prototypes

They develop wireframes of different layouts and perhaps also higher-fidelity mock-ups or prototypes based on the results of feedback from users.

#### User flows

They design how users should move through a system is another popular deliverable.

#### Design Patterns

They use common patterns that provide consistent and  effective user interface designs. For example, picking the right UI elements (e.g. module tabs, breadcrumbs, slideshows) for certain tasks based on their effectiveness and what leads to better and more familiar experiences. 

#### User profiles and personas

They know their audience. This is the first step in UX design and enables you to develop experiences that reflect the voice and emotions of your users. Personas can be developed using website data.

#### Content inventory

They create an inventory of site content, which is an organized list of pages on a website. Doing a content inventory is a step towards proposing changes in information architecture to enhance the user experience (e.g. user flow, findability and efficiency).

#### Content style guides

They create content style guides which give writers and designers a framework in which to work when creating content and developing a design, and they also ensure that the brand and design elements align with the owner’s goals.

##UX / UI Design

### Tools

- [BalsaImiq](https://balsamiq.com/)&mdash;A rapid wire-framing tool that reproduces the experience of sketching on a whiteboard.
  - Both desktop and web based versions are available.
    - Desktop version: runs on Windows and Mac OS.
    - Cloud version: runs in any browser and integrates with Google Drive.
  - Mainly used to create "lo-fidelity" wireframes as opposed to "hi-fidelity" UI designs.  
    This tool is mainly used by *developers* rather than *designers*.
  - Wireframes can be connected together as working prototypes.
  - I have requested a free cloud account for everyone in the class.
- [Pencil](http://pencil.evolus.vn)&mdash;A desktop GUI diagramming tool that is easy to use to create wire-frames or mock-ups.
     - Free, open-source.

     - Runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)&mdash; A collaborative web application for interface and UX design.
     - Mainly used by *designers* rather than *developers*.
     - Free account with limited features.
     - Can be used to generate actual user interfaces.
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)&mdash;A visual work-space that combines diagramming, data visualization and collaboration.
     - Free accounts for students.
     - Web app, runs in a browser.
- [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)&mdash;Part of the Google Docs web based suite of applications. This is not specifically for UX design. It is a general purpose drawing tool, so it will take more effort to use it to produce wireframes or mock-ups.
     - Free
     - Quick, easy line drawings.
