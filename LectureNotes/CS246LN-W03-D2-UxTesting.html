      <h1>User Experience Testing</h1>
      Getting user feedback early and often is the heart of any Agile
      development process!<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Overview of UX Testing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between usability testing and
          functional testing?</li>
        <li>Types of usability testing:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual testers</li>
          <li>Focus groups</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Means of getting feedback</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Surveys</li>
          <li>Interviews</li>
          <li>Recordings of testers- audio and/or video</li>
          <li>Instrumenting the code (for alpha and beta testing)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What to test</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Sketches (even on a napkin!)</li>
          <li>Wire-frames<br>
          </li>
          <li>Mock-ups</li>
          <li>Prototypes</li>
          <li>Real code<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>My experience at Intel with focus groups</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Built mock-ups and prototypes</li>
        <li>Wrote a test script<br>
          (Mock-ups had "canned" responses, so following a test script
          was essential).</li>
        <li>Three or four people were in each focus group. They were
          selected and paid by a professional agency.</li>
        <li>Participants were in a room with a computer and a
          moderator.&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Observers were in another room watching through a one-way
            mirror.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>We had video cameras recording the participants.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A professional moderator read the script.&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This helps avoid the problem of participants not wanting
            to hurt the developers' feelings and of the developer
            grimacing and looking hurt in front of the participants</li>
          <li>The participants didn't touch the computer; they just
            watched and answered questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>We developers all watched the videos afterward and discussed
          the participants' responses.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Rocket Surgery made easy approach</h2>
      Based on the Book: <span style="font-style: italic;">Rocket
        Surgery Made Easy, The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and
        Fixing Usability Problems</span>, <br>
      by Steve Krug, 2010.&nbsp; <br>

      <ul>
        <li>"A morning a month, that's all we ask"</li>
        <li>It's a minimum, for Agile, at the end of every sprint.</li>
        <li>Start earlier than you think makes sense</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Show participants anything from sketches to working code</li>
          <li>The earlier you start, the less you'll have to change</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Recruit loosely and grade on the curve</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting people who are like your "target audience" is a
            nice goal, but don't be too strict about it.</li>
          <li>Don't use the same group of testers twice (unless all they
            saw were sketches)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make it a spectator sport (about the observers)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The eureka moment: the users aren't all like me!</li>
          <li>Watching live is more impactful than watching a recording</li>
          <li>Get the whole development team to watch - even the project
            sponsors<br>
            (but having them in another room is less intimidating to the
            participants)</li>
          <li>Give them instructions (what to watch for)</li>
          <li>Be ready for criticism, take it as constructive and
            helpful</li>
          <li>Provide food (snacks)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Focus ruthlessly on a small number of the most important
          problems.</li>
        <li>Hold a debriefing and produce</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A list of the most serious problems</li>
          <li>A list (smaller) of what you will fix before the next test</li>
          <li>More food (lunch)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When fixing problems, always do the least you can do</li>
        <ul>
          <li>"What's the smallest, simplest change we can make that's
            likely to keep people from having the problem we observed?"</li>
          <li>"The perfect is the enemy of the good"<br>
            (Opposite of the "good is the enemy of the best")</li>
          <li>Taking something away is sometimes better than adding
            something.</li>
          <li>Avoid redesign unless it's really necessary</li>
          <li>Only re-test major changes, not tweaks<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>Create a set of UI artifacts (at least three) and get feedback
        from at least three testers.<br>
        Submit the following:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>The artifacts you gave your testers.<br>
          Possibilities include: a working application, a prototype,
          mock-ups, or sketches.</li>
        <li>A report that includes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A description the method(s) you used to get feedback. <br>
            Possibilities include: individual interviews, surveys, focus
            groups.</li>
          <li>The results of your testing.<br>
          </li>
          <li>An assessment of the quality of feedback you received.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <ul>
      </ul>
