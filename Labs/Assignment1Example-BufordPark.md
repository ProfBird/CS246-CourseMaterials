# Proposal for Software for the Friends of Buford Park and Mt. Pisgah

## Mission of the organization

From the [web site](https://www.bufordpark.org):

> Founded in 1989, the Mission of Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah is to protect and enhance native ecosystems and compatible recreation in the Mt. Pisgah area.
>

## Software Proposal

In order to better recruit and manage volunteers, we propose adding the following features to the web site:

- Online volunteer application form. The form will provide a way to enter:

  - Contact information
  - Projects they are interested in. There will be a dynamically generated list of projects from which volunteers can select.

- Online volunteer scheduling for projects.

  Volunteers will be able to see times available for work on various projects and they will be able to add themselves to the schedule.

- Administrative pages which are only available to management:

  - A database of projects.
  - A database of volunteers. This would include information from their volunteer application, the projects they are currently working on, and their schedules.
