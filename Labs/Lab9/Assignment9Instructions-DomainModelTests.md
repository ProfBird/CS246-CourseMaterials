# Testing Your Domain Model Design

## Assignment 9

### Instructions

- Identify the three user-stories that have the highest risk of being difficult or maybe even impossible to implement because of the design of your domain model.
- Add controller classes, a repository interface, real and fake repositories to accommodate testing those three user-stories. You don't need to implement anything that isn't needed for your testing.
- Write at least three unit tests to verify your domain model design. 
- Refactor your domain model if needed.

### Submission

- Upload a file containing:

  1. The three (or more) user-stories you chose as being highest risk.
  2. The reasons you thought those were the highest risk.
  3. The results of your testing and whether or not you refactored your domain model.

- If you refactored your domain model, a new UML class diagram as a PDF.

- Submit a link in the on-line text of the Moodle submission for the Git repository containing your web app with unit tests.
