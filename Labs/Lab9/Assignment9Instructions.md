# Testing Your Domain Model Design

## Assignment 9

### Instructions

- Identify three user-stories that have the highest risk of being difficult or maybe even impossible to implement. These could be difficult because of:
  - The complexity of relationships in your domain model. If this is the case, prototype the domain model classes.
  - The need to write code for something you never did before, like file uploading, or online payment. If this is the case, do a "bare bones" experimental implementation of that.

- Create just the part of your domain model that you need to test implementation of the high risk user stories.
- Use scaffolding to create contorllers and views for testing. You will need to modify the scaffolded CRUD operations to work with any complex model classes. But, you don't need to implement anything that isn't needed for your testing.
- Refactor your domain model if needed.

### Submission

- Upload a file containing:

  1. The three (or more) user-stories you chose as being highest risk.
  2. The reasons you thought those were the highest risk.
  3. The results of your testing and whether or not you refactored your domain model.

- If you refactored your domain model, a new UML class diagram as a PDF.

- Submit a link in the on-line text of the Moodle submission for the Git repository containing your prototype web app.
