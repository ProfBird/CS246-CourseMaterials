## Design a model for a simple game

Create a UML diagram to model a simple game

1. Write a prose description (text description) for one of the following dice games. Include the players and score keeping for multiple rounds of play in your model.

   - [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps)

   - [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

   - [Ship, Captan, Crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship,_captain,_and_crew)

   - A simple [dice game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dice_games) of your choice (nothing nearly as complicated as Yahtzee).

2. 

Use [ASP.NET Patterns every developer should know](https://www.developerfusion.com/article/8307/aspnet-patterns-every-developer-should-know/) as a reference for this assignment.

1. Look at your Core ASP.NET term project web apps from last term. What design patterns can you identify&mdash;either formal patterns or informal. Provide a list of design patterns you found,
2. Think about the user stories you put in the backlog for your project in the previous lab assignment. Which of these might benefit from applying design patterns when you code the solutions to the user stories? Provide this information
   - The user story
   - The design pattern to be used
   - How this design pattern solves this problem.



Submit one document in which you report on your findings and conclusions for both parts 1 and 2 for your whole team.
