# Assignment 4 - OOP Design

## Part 1: Designing a model for a simple game

Create a UML diagram to model a simple game

1. Write a prose description (text description) for one of the following dice games. Include the players and score keeping for multiple rounds of play in your model. (Your description of the game can be different from the one shown in the link--you can adapt it, simplify it, etc.)

   - [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps)

   - [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

   - [Ship, Captan, Crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship,_captain,_and_crew)

   - A simple dice game of your choice (nothing nearly as complicated as Yahtzee).
2. Make a list of the classes, fields, and methods you will use to model the game. (Don't include user interface, it's not part of the logical model.)
3. Make a UML class diagram of your model. Include:
   - Classes with their fields and methods.
   - Relationships (inheritance, aggregation, or composition)
   - Cardinality
