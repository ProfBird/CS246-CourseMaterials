# Assignment 4 - OOP Design

## Part 1: Designing a model for a simple game

Create a UML diagram to model a simple game

1. Write a prose description (text description) for one of the following dice games. Include the players and score keeping for multiple rounds of play in your model. (Your description of the game can be different from the one shown in the article linked below&mdash;you can adapt it, simplify it, etc.)

   - [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps)

   - [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game))

   - [Ship, Captan, Crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship,_captain,_and_crew)

   - A simple dice game of your choice (nothing nearly as complicated as Yahtzee).
2. Make a list of nouns and verbs without trying to identify classes, fields, or methods.
3. Make a list of the classes, fields, and methods you will use to model the game. 
   - Don't include user a interface, it's not part of the logical model.
   - You probably won't use every noun and verb from the list in (2).
3. Make a UML class diagram of your model. Include:
   - Classes with their fields, properties and methods.
   - Relationships (inheritance, aggregation, or composition)
   - Cardinality (aka multiplicity)
