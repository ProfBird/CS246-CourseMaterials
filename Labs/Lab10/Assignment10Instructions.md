# Final Design Documentation

## Assignment 10

### Instructions

- Create a design document for your project. This is a new document which will include elements from many of your previous documents. Your design document should include these sections:
  - Project overview
    This will be an updated version of the overview in your project proposal.
  - Domain model
    Update the UML class diagram you already made for the domain model, include a short written description that explains the key user stories that determined the relationships between classes.
  - UI Diagrams
    Organize the UI diagrams in sub-sections according to the list of features in the project overview. 
    - Give each UI diagram a figure number and title. 
    - At the beginning of each sub-section give a short explanation of how the UI will work and how it implements the feature.
    - List the model objects used by this UI view.
  - A project schedule
    Make a list of sprints with a list of the features (from the list in the project overview) to be implemented in each sprint along with the beginning and end dates for each sprint. No new features should be implemented in the last sprint. It should just be for testing and bug fixing.
