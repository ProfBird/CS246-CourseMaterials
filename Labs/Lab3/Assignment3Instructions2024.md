# Assignment 3 - UX Design and Testing

Your team will create UX *test artifacts* (diagrams, mock-ups, or prototypes), recruit testers to test them and write a report on the test feedback.

## Test artifacts

Create a set of UX test artifacts&mdash;at least one per group member. All the test artifacts should be for the same web app or game. You will need to collaborate on the design so all the diagrams have the same look and feel. 

## Testing

As a group, recruit at least three testers. Get feedback on the usability and user experience of your group's UI artifacts from them. You can do this in a focus group setting or through individual testers working with your UI.

## UX Testing Report

You will describe the process and results of your UI testing in a report that includes:

- A description the method(s) you used to get feedback. 
      Possibilities include: 
  - Individual interviews.
  - surveys.
  - Recordings of the testers reactions and comments while testing.
- The results of your testing.
- An assessment of the quality of feedback you received. (How good is the feedback and how do you know it's good.)

### Division of Work

I will let you as a team decide how to distribute the work, but here are some guidelines:

- Each team member should create at least one test artifact.
- Each team member should recruit a tester, or at least be involved in recruiting testers.
- Each team member should write at least one paragraph of the testing report.

## Submission

- **The test report**
  On Moodle, submit this as a Word or PDF document.
- **Team contribution report**
  Submit a second document describing who did which parts of the project. 

Only one group member needs to submit the assignment on behalf of the whole group.
