# Assignment 2 - Agile User Stories

 For this assignment, your job is to lay the groundwork for a program by setting up a project using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), generating a number of user stories and adding them to the backlog. You will work in groups of 3-4. For this assignment, you will be creating user stories for the software project proposal from the previous assignment.

You all should have Jira accounts, but just one team member will create the project for your assignment. Your group should generate at least 20 user stories and enter them in the backlog. 

- Create at least one epic and create at least two linked child stories for it.
- Assign story points to each story.
- Identify five stories and move them into the first sprint.
  - Assign a team member to each user story.
  - Break each story down into two or more tasks. Each task should be small in scope…breaking a project down into small tasks makes it easier to divide up work and track progress (note: you will not actually be carrying out the tasks for this assignment). 
- Once you’ve set up the first sprint, prioritize the remaining stories in your backlog by arranging them in priority order. This is the order in which you tentatively plan to implement them.
