# Assignment 2 - Agile User Stories

## Objectives

- Learn to write user stories.
- Learn to set up product and sprint backlogs.
- Learn to plan a sprint.
- Learn to use Jira

Notes: 

- You will not actually build this software. You are just doing this as a way to practice sprint planning using Jira.
- Normally your team would write a requirements document (a more detailed description of the project than the proposal) and the user stories would be based on the requirements document. We are skipping that step in the project planning process.

## Instructions

For this assignment, your job is to lay the groundwork for a developing a hypothetical software app by setting up a project using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), generating a number of user stories and adding them to the backlog. You will work in groups of 3-4. For this assignment, you will be creating user stories for the software project proposal from the previous assignment.

You all should have Jira accounts, but just one team member will create the project for your assignment. All the team members can be added to the project through the site admin page for the site hosting the project.

- Your group should generate at least 20 user stories and enter them in the backlog. (The main backlog is sometimes called the *product backlog*.)

- Create at least fours epics and put at least two user stories under each epic.
- Assign story points to each story.
- Identify at least four user stories and move them into the first sprint. (This is the *sprint backlog*.)
  - Each team member should assign themselves to at least one user story from the sprint backlog.
  - Each team member should create at least two tasks for each user of your user stories.
- Once youâ€™ve set up the first sprint, prioritize the remaining stories in your backlog by arranging them in priority order. This is the order in which you tentatively plan to implement them.
