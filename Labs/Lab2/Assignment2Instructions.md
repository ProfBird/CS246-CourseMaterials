# Assignment 2 - Agile User Stories

 For this assignment, your job is to lay the groundwork for a program by setting up a project using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), generating a number of user stories and adding them to the backlog. You will work in groups of 3-4. For this assignment, you will be creating user stories for the software project proposal from the previous assignment.

You all should have Jira accounts, but just one team member will create the project for your assignment. All the team members can be added to the project through the site admin page for the site hosting the project.

- Your group should generate at least 20 user stories and enter them in the backlog. (The main backlog is sometimes called the product backlog.)

- Create at least one epic that has at least two user stories under it.
- Assign story points to each story.
- Identify five user stories and move them into the first sprint. (This  is the sprint backlog.)
  - Assign a team member to each user story in the sprint.
  - Create at least two tasks for each user story in the sprint.
- Once youâ€™ve set up the first sprint, prioritize the remaining stories in your backlog by arranging them in priority order. This is the order in which you tentatively plan to implement them.
