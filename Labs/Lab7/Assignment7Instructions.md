# Assignment 7 - User Stories

## Instructions

This week you will be writing epics and user stories. You can base these off of the software development proposal, UI diagrams, and conversations you've had with your client. Write your user stories in a way that your client can understand them&mdash;especially the UI related stories (which is usually most of them).

Often, the process of thinking of user stories helps you refine your UI diagrams, so you may go back and revise or add to your UI diagrams as you come up with user stories.

You don't need to add tasks (Jira calls them "child issues") now. You will add those to stories at the time you move the stories from the product backlog to a sprint backlog.

Meet with your client to show them the user stories and any revisions you made to the UI diagrams. See if the client can use the user stories and UI diagrams together to walk through the user interactions with the web site. Get their feedback. 

## Submission

- Submit your Jira user stories by pasting the URL for your project in the "online text" field for this Moodle assignment.
- Submit a short written report on the meeting with your client.
