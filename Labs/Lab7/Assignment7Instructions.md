# Assignment 7 - UX Design & User Stories

## Instructions

You will be writing user stories and making UI diagrams in parallel. The process of making the UI diagrams often helps you clarify or discover user stories. Write your user stories in a way that your client can understand them&mdash;especially the UX related stories.

Make your UI diagrams neat, detailed, and clear enough that you can use them to communicate your UX design to your client. Make them look professional. If you draw them by hand, use a ruler or other drawing aids and draw on graph paper with a very lightly printed graph, or on white paper&mdash;not lined paper.

Meet with your client to show them the UI diagrams. See if the client can read the user stories and follow them to walk through the UX interactions using your UI diagrams. Get their feedback. 

## Submission

- Submit your UI sketches. If you did them online, save them as a PDF (or PDFs) and upload them. If you are doing them by hand, take photos.
- Submit your Jira user stories by pasting the URL for your project in the "online text" field for this Moodle assignment.
- Submit a short written report on the meeting with your client.
- Submit a schedule for your bi-weekly client meetings for this term and next.
