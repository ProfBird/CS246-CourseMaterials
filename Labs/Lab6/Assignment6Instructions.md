# Assignment 6 - Team Contract and UX Design

## Instructions

Both parts A and B will be done as a team with each member of the team contributing equally to the overall effort.

### Part A

Write a team contract based on the Team Contract Template posted on Moodle. As a team, you will need to discuss each point in the contract and decide your team policy for that point.

### Part B

Make UI diagrams based on your discussions with your client and the software proposal. Make your UI diagrams detailed and clear enough that you can use them to communicate your UX design to your client. Make them look professional.

## Submission

- Use the Lab 6A assignment link to submit your completed team contract as a Word document or PDF.
- Use the Lab 6B assignment link to submit your UI diagrams in a single PDF file.
