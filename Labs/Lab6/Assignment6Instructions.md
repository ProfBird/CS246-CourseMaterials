# Assignment 6 - Team Contract and UX Design

## Instructions

Both parts A and B will be done as a team with each member of the team contributing equally to the overall effort.

### Part A: Team Contract

Write a team contract based on the Team Contract Template posted on Moodle. As a team, you will need to discuss each point in the contract and decide your team policy for that point.

### Part B: UI Wireframes

Make wireframe UI diagrams of all the web site pages in the site as described in the software proposal. The UI diagrams don't need to include every detail, but make your UI diagrams detailed enough that you can use them to communicate your UX design to your client. 

You can divide up the task of drawing UI wireframes among your team members, but in order to make the pages consistent with each other, you should collaborate on the home page to decide how you will do things like navigation and page layout so that as each team member makes diagrams additional pages, those things will be consistent.

## Submission

Submit your completed work on Moodle:

- Use the Lab 6A assignment link to submit your completed team contract as a Word document or PDF.
- Use the Lab 6B assignment link to submit your UI diagrams in a single PDF file.
