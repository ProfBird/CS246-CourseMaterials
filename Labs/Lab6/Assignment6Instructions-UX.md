# Assignment 6: UX Design

[TOC]

## Instructions

Both parts A and B will be done as a team with each member of the team contributing equally to the overall effort.

### Part A: Site Map and Wireframes

#### Site Map

Make a site map that shows the navigation paths between all the web pages. Determine what pages will be needed based on the requirements document you wrote last week.

#### Wireframes

Make wireframe UI diagrams of all the web site pages in the site. The UI diagrams don't need to include every detail, but make your UI diagrams detailed enough that you can use them to communicate your UX design to your client. 

You can divide up the task of drawing UI wireframes among your team members, but in order to make the pages consistent with each other, you should collaborate on the home page to decide how you will do things like navigation and page layout so that as each team member makes diagrams additional pages, those things will be consistent.

### Part B: UX Testing

Meet with your client and/or potential end users of the web site you are designing for your client and show them the sitemap and wireframes. Use a survey or interview to get feedback on your design in the same way you did for [lab 3 on UX Design and Testing](../Lab3/Assignment3Instructions.html).

Report on the feedback you got from your client and/or testers.

### Part C: Revised UX Diagrams

Based on feedback from UX testing, revise the sitemap and wireframes. Make a list of the diagrams that have changed with a very brief description of the changes on each diagram.



## Submission

Submit your completed work on Moodle:

- Use the Lab 6A assignment to submit your site map as a PDF, and the UI diagrams in a second single PDF file
- Use the Lab 6B assignment to submit your report on the UX testing in a PDF or Word document.
- Use the Lab 6C assignment to submit your revised site map as a PDF, the revised UI diagrams in a second single PDF, and a PDF or Word document listing the diagrams that have changed.

In the online text for each submission, briefly list what each team member contributed to the work.
