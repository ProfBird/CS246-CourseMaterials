# Proposal for Software for the Friends of Buford Park and Mt. Pisgah

## Mission of the organization

The Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah is a non-profit organization  with a mission to protect and enhance native ecosystems and compatible recreation in the Mt. Pisgah area. They work towards conserving the area's botanical, fish, wildlife and recreational values by mobilizing funding, scientific expertise and volunteer resources. The Friends also aim to steward the land & waters, connect people & nature, and create a legacy of healthy habitats.

## Software Proposal

In order to better recruit and manage volunteers, we propose adding the following features to the web site:

- Online volunteer application form. The form will provide a way to enter:

  - Contact information
  - Projects they are interested in. There will be a dynamically generated list of projects from which volunteers can select.

- Online volunteer scheduling for projects.

  Volunteers will be able to see times available for work on various projects and they will be able to add themselves to the schedule.

- Administrative pages which are only available to management:

  - A database of projects.
  - A database of volunteers. This would include information from their volunteer application, the projects they are currently working on, and their schedules.
