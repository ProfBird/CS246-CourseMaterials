[TOC]

This case study is presented in the form of a fictitious interview between a systems analyst and a business owner.

## Participants

- **Owner**: Sarah Miller, Owner and Manager of Nature’s Crunch
- **Analyst**: David Lopez, Systems Analyst

## Interview Transcript

**David:** Thanks for meeting with me, Sarah. Can you start by telling me about Nature’s Crunch?

**Sarah:** Of course. Nature’s Crunch is a small company that makes organic granola and granola bars. We pride ourselves on using locally sourced organic ingredients and selling high-quality products. We’ve been in business for about seven years. Our products are sold wholesale to grocery stores, health food shops, and cafes, and we also have a small retail store attached to our factory.

### Challenge 1: Inventory Management

**David:** What are some of the challenges you’re facing right now?

**Sarah:** Inventory is a big one. We manage everything manually with spreadsheets, and it’s becoming harder to keep track of raw materials, finished products, and stock levels in the retail store.

**David:** I imagine that could lead to issues like overstocking or running out of ingredients?

**Sarah:** Exactly. We’ve had situations where we underestimated ingredient needs and had to delay production, which affects wholesale orders. On the other hand, sometimes we overbuy and have too much stock sitting around, tying up cash flow.

### Challenge 2: Production Scheduling

**David:** How do you handle production scheduling?

**Sarah:** It’s mostly based on experience and guesswork. We try to plan based on previous orders, but sometimes wholesale clients place larger-than-expected orders, and we scramble to adjust. It’s stressful trying to balance wholesale demand with keeping our retail store stocked.

**David:** So, you’d benefit from a system that helps you forecast demand and optimize production?

**Sarah:** Yes, that would make a huge difference.

### Challenge 3: Wholesale Order Management

**David:** How do you manage your wholesale orders?

**Sarah:** We process orders through email or phone, and I manually enter them into our system. It’s time-consuming, and there have been times when orders were missed or entered incorrectly.

**David:** Would a centralized system to manage and track orders be helpful?

**Sarah:** Absolutely. It would save so much time and reduce errors.

### Challenge 4: Retail Store Operations

**David:** Tell me about your retail store. How do you manage sales and inventory there?

**Sarah:** The store does pretty well, but we’re still using a basic cash register system. It doesn’t track inventory, so we have to do physical counts regularly. It’s also hard to tell what products are selling well.

**David:** Would you want a modern POS[^1] system to track sales and inventory automatically?

**Sarah:** Definitely. It would also be great if it could connect to our production system so we can plan better.

### Challenge 5: Marketing and Online Presence

**David:** How do you market your products?

**Sarah:** Mostly word of mouth, plus a bit of social media and a very basic website. We don’t sell online yet, but I think it could be a great way to reach more customers, especially for our unique flavors.

**David:** Would you like to expand your website to include an online store?

**Sarah:** Yes, but I’d need something simple to start with. Maybe a way to sell prepackaged gift boxes or sampler packs.

### Challenge 6: Reporting and Analytics

**David:** Do you have a way to track how your business is doing overall?

**Sarah:** Not really. I’d love to have reports on things like sales trends, production efficiency, and inventory costs. Right now, I’m flying blind when it comes to making decisions.

**David:** So, a reporting tool that aggregates data from all aspects of the business would be useful?

**Sarah:** Very useful.
