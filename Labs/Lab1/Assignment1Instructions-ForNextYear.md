# Instructions for Assignment 1

**CS246&mdash;System Design**



## Objective

Evaluate a local organization (business, non-profit, club, etc.) by investigating their web site. Develop a proposal to develop a software system that will benefit them. Here are some possibilities:

- Enhance an existing web site, or develop a new one. Here are the types of business solutions a web site might provide.
  - Sell products.
  - Get leads for new clients.
  - Build a mailing list.
  - Recruit volunteers.
  - Educate users.
  - Provide administrative functions for managing employees, volunteers, or clients.
- Provide a mobile app that works in conjunction with an existing web site to increase engagement.
- Develop a Web API for use by third parties that would in some way benefit the organization.



One place to start when looking for a business to evaluate is a local Chamber of Commerce site. Here are some local links:
