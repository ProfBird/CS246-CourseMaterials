# Case Study 5B: "GreenEarth Landscaping

**Case Study: Enhancing Operations at GreenEarth Landscaping**



**Participants:**

​	•	**Owner:** Sarah Johnson, Owner of GreenEarth Landscaping

​	•	**Systems Analyst:** James Miller



**Interview Transcript**



**James:** Thanks for meeting with me, Sarah. Can you start by giving me a quick overview of GreenEarth Landscaping?



**Sarah:** Of course. GreenEarth Landscaping is a residential landscaping and yard maintenance business. We’ve been operating for about 10 years and have a team of 12 employees. We offer services like mowing, weeding, planting, irrigation system maintenance, seasonal cleanup, and landscape design.



**James:** Sounds like a full-service operation! What would you say are the main challenges you’re currently facing?



**Challenge 1: Scheduling and Work Assignments**



**Sarah:** One of our biggest challenges is scheduling. With 12 employees and dozens of clients, it’s tough to organize who goes where and ensure we have the right team for each job.



**James:** How do you currently handle scheduling?



**Sarah:** It’s mostly manual. We use a combination of spreadsheets and phone calls. It works, but it’s inefficient and prone to errors. Sometimes we double-book teams or forget to assign certain tasks.



**James:** Would a system that lets you schedule jobs and assign teams digitally be helpful?



**Sarah:** Absolutely. Ideally, the system could also notify employees about their schedules and send reminders for upcoming jobs.



**Challenge 2: Client Management**



**James:** How do you manage your client information?



**Sarah:** We keep basic records in spreadsheets—contact details, addresses, and the services they’ve requested. But it’s hard to keep track of things like recurring services, special requests, or payment history.



**James:** Would a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system help?



**Sarah:** Yes, as long as it’s simple to use. We need a way to track client preferences, service history, and invoices in one place.



**Challenge 3: Employee Management**



**James:** You mentioned having 12 employees. How do you manage their time and track their work?



**Sarah:** It’s pretty informal. Employees log their hours on paper timesheets, which I have to manually enter into our payroll system. And tracking who’s working on what project can get confusing.



**James:** Would you benefit from a system where employees could log their hours and tasks digitally?



**Sarah:** Definitely. Something mobile-friendly would be ideal since most of the team is out in the field.



**Challenge 4: Equipment and Inventory Management**



**James:** What about equipment and materials? How do you keep track of those?



**Sarah:** That’s another challenge. We have a lot of equipment—mowers, trimmers, leaf blowers—and it’s hard to keep track of who’s using what and when. We’ve also had issues with running out of materials like mulch or fertilizer because we forgot to reorder in time.



**James:** So, an equipment tracking system and inventory management tools could help?



**Sarah:** Yes, especially if the system could remind us to reorder supplies or schedule maintenance for equipment.



**Challenge 5: Customer Communication and Billing**



**James:** How do you currently handle communication with clients?



**Sarah:** Mostly by phone and email. Clients call to book services, request changes, or ask for quotes. It works, but it’s not the most efficient process.



**James:** Would an online booking system or customer portal be useful?



**Sarah:** Yes, that would be a game-changer. If clients could book services, make payments, and see their service history online, it would save us a lot of time.



**Challenge 6: Business Growth**



**James:** It sounds like your business is doing well. Are you looking to grow?



**Sarah:** Definitely, but managing everything manually makes it hard to scale. We’d like to take on more clients and offer additional services, but we need better systems in place first.
