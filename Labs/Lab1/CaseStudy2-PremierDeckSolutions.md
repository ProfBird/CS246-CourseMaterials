- **Analyst**: Jason Chen, Systems Analyst

## Interview Transcript

**Jason:** Thanks for meeting with me, Emily. Can you start by giving me a little background on your company?

**Emily:** Absolutely. Premier Deck Solutions is a full-service company specializing in designing, building, and maintaining custom decks for residential homes. We’ve been in business for 10 years and have built a solid reputation in our community. Most of our clients come through word of mouth or referrals, but I feel like we could improve a lot in how we manage projects and communicate with clients.

### Challenge 1: Project Management

**Jason:** Let’s dive into that. What specific issues are you facing with project management?

**Emily:** Right now, we manage projects manually using spreadsheets and email. It works, but it’s not efficient. For example, when a client requests a change mid-project, it can take a while to communicate that to the team on-site, and sometimes things slip through the cracks.

**Jason:** I see. So, better communication and tracking changes in real-time would help?

**Emily:** Definitely. It would also be great if we could have a centralized system where we can track project timelines, materials used, and progress updates.

### Challenge 2: Client Communication

**Jason:** How do you currently communicate with your clients throughout the project?

**Emily:** It’s mostly through emails and phone calls. It gets messy sometimes, especially when clients ask for updates or revisions. We also don’t have a formal way to provide them with progress updates or share design plans once the project is underway.

**Jason:** Would a client portal or some way to centralize communication be useful?

**Emily:** That would be amazing. A place where clients could see progress updates, invoices, and schedules in one place would save a ton of time.

### Challenge 3: Estimating and Quoting

**Jason:** How do you handle estimates and quotes for new projects?

**Emily:** Right now, it’s a manual process. We visit the site, take measurements, and then create a quote in Excel. It’s time-consuming, and sometimes we miss things that come up later as unexpected costs.

**Jason:** Would an automated system that could help with generating quotes and flagging potential cost overruns be useful?

**Emily:** Absolutely. Especially if it could integrate with a design tool where we could show clients their deck in 3D and calculate costs automatically.

### Challenge 4: Scheduling and Resource Allocation

**Jason:** How do you manage your team and schedule projects?

**Emily:** Scheduling is another pain point. We manage everything with a shared calendar, but it’s not ideal. When a project gets delayed—because of weather or material delays, for example—it’s a scramble to adjust schedules and make sure the team knows where they’re supposed to be.

**Jason:** So, a dynamic scheduling system that adapts to changes would help?

**Emily:** Exactly. Something that notifies the team in real-time and helps us allocate resources, like crew members and equipment, more efficiently.

### Challenge 5: Marketing and Lead Generation

**Jason:** You mentioned earlier that most of your clients come from referrals. Do you have a formal process for attracting new leads?

**Emily:** Not really. We have a basic website, but it’s outdated and doesn’t bring in much traffic. We’re also not great at following up with leads or tracking where they came from.

**Jason:** Would you be interested in a CRM system to manage leads and a more modern online presence?

**Emily:** Yes! A way to capture leads from our website and track them through the sales process would be great. And if we could integrate that with a better website that showcases our portfolio, it would help us stand out.
