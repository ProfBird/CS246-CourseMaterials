# Instructions for Assignment 1

**CS246&mdash;System Design**



## Objective

Evaluate a local organization (business, non-profit, club, etc.) to identify their potential business needs and write a proposal to develop software that will meet some of those needs. Here are some possibilities:

- Enhance an existing web site, or develop a new one. Here are some possible purposes for a web site.
  - Sell products.
  - Get leads for new clients.
  - Build a mailing list.
  - Recruit volunteers.
  - Educate users.
  - Provide administrative functions for managing employees, volunteers, or clients.
- Provide a mobile app that works in conjunction with an existing web site to increase engagement.
- Develop a Web API for use by third parties that would in some way benefit the organization.



One place to start when looking for a business to evaluate is a local Chamber of Commerce site. Here are some local links

## Report Requirements

The document you submit should  be at least one page long, but not more than two, and should be written in clear and concise English sentences and paragraphs. The document should answer these questions:

- What does the organization do?

- 
  What business problem(s) or needs have you identified?

  These should be business needs you have inferred from their web site, not short-comings of their existing web site.

- 
  Software solution:
  
  Address at least three of the business needs you identified.
  
  - What problem(s) will the software solve and how will it solve them?
  
    These would be solutions to business needs that do not already appear to be provided by the current web site.
  
  - What type of software will you develop (mobile app, web app, etc.)
  
  - What will the software do?
