- **Analyst**: Mark Lewis, Systems Analyst

## Interview Transcript

**Mark:** Hi Sarah, thanks for meeting with me. Let’s start by discussing your business and the challenges you’re currently facing. Could you give me an overview of Taste of Heaven?

**Sarah:** Sure, Taste of Heaven is a family-owned restaurant. We’ve been serving comfort food in this neighborhood for over 15 years, and we have a loyal customer base. Business has been steady, but with so much competition, we feel like we’re falling behind. We need to modernize to stay relevant.

### Challenge 1: Table Management

**Mark:** I see. Let’s break it down. What are some specific areas where you think you could improve?

**Sarah:** One big issue is table management. During peak hours, we often have long wait times. Right now, we use a paper chart to manage reservations and seating, and it’s not efficient. Mistakes happen, and customers get frustrated if they’re waiting too long or feel like they’ve been skipped.

**Mark:** Got it. So, a better system for handling reservations and seating arrangements?

**Sarah:** Exactly. It’d be great if we could have a digital system to track table availability in real time and maybe even allow customers to book online. Also, something that helps us predict when we’ll be busiest would be very helpful.

### Challenge 2: Order Processing

**Mark:** That makes sense. What about your ordering process? How is that currently handled?

**Sarah:** We still use paper pads to take orders. The waitstaff write everything down and either shout it to the kitchen or manually enter it into an old terminal we’ve been using forever. Mistakes happen—like wrong orders or missed details about dietary preferences—and it slows everything down.

**Mark:** So you’re looking for a way to digitize order processing?

**Sarah:** Yes. Ideally, we’d like waitstaff to use tablets or something similar. It’d be great if orders went straight to the kitchen and included all the details, like modifications or allergies.

### Challenge 3: Customer Engagement

**Mark:** Let’s talk about your customers. Do you have any strategies for keeping them engaged or bringing them back?

**Sarah:** Not really. That’s another area we’re falling behind. We don’t have a loyalty program or a way to personalize promotions. Most of our marketing is word of mouth or a few local ads, but we don’t have much of an online presence.

**Mark:** So, you’d like to implement a loyalty program and perhaps collect customer data to tailor promotions?

**Sarah:** Exactly. Something to reward our regulars and encourage new customers to come back. We also need a way to get structured feedback to figure out what we’re doing well and where we can improve.

### Challenge 4: Inventory Management

**Mark:** How about your inventory management?

**Sarah:** It’s all manual right now. We track everything with spreadsheets and handwritten notes. Sometimes we run out of key ingredients during a rush, and other times, we overstock items that just go to waste.

**Mark:** That must be stressful. Would an automated system for tracking inventory help?

**Sarah:** Absolutely. It’d be great if it could tie into our sales so we could see what dishes are most popular and predict when we need to reorder.

### Challenge 5: Online Sales and Delivery

**Mark:** Let’s move on to online sales. Do you offer takeout or delivery?

**Sarah:** We do takeout, but it’s very basic—customers have to call in their orders. We’re not on any delivery apps, and we don’t have our own online ordering system. It’s a huge missed opportunity, especially since so many people prefer ordering online now.

**Mark:** I see. So, you’re looking for a way to expand into online ordering and delivery services?

**Sarah:** Yes. We’d love to have a system that lets customers place orders online, whether for pickup or delivery. And if it could integrate with platforms like DoorDash or Uber Eats, that would be a bonus.
