# Case Study 5: "Sunnyside Gardens" Market Garden

## Market Garden Interview Transcript

**Ms. Jones (interviewer):** "Good morning, Mr. Anderson. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm Sarah Jones, a systems analyst, and I'm here to learn more about your business, Sunnyside Gardens, and explore how technology might be able to improve your operations."

**Mr. Anderson (owner):** "Good morning, Ms. Jones. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, come in. I'm always happy to talk about the farm."

**Ms. Jones:** "To start, could you tell me a little bit about the history of Sunnyside Gardens?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "Sure. We've been farming this land for 25 years, growing a wide variety of seasonal produce. We started with just a few local restaurants and a small farmers market stand, but over time, we've expanded to include a thriving CSA program and a larger farm stand on-site."

**Ms. Jones:** "That's fantastic. Can you describe your current operations in a bit more detail?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "Certainly. We have 10 full-time employees and 15 seasonal workers. Our day-to-day involves: **Production Planning:** We carefully plan our planting schedules based on demand from restaurants, CSA members, and the farm stand.  **Planting and Harvesting:** We follow organic practices and meticulously track our planting and harvesting dates.  **Order Fulfillment:** We process orders from restaurants, manage CSA shares, and fulfill customer orders at the farm stand.  **Inventory Management:** We keep track of our inventory manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.  **Financial Management:** We handle invoicing, payments, and payroll manually as well.  **Marketing and Sales:** We promote our CSA program, manage social media, and participate in local events to increase visibility."

**Ms. Jones:** "Can you tell me more about your inventory tracking process?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "Currently, we use a combination of spreadsheets and handwritten notes. We have a separate sheet for each crop, where we record planting dates, harvest yields, and sales. We also keep a physical inventory log at the farm stand. However, it's easy for things to slip through the cracks. Sometimes we over-order supplies, which leads to waste, and other times we run out of popular items before the next harvest."

**Ms. Jones:** "How do you currently fulfill orders from your different sales channels?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "For restaurant orders, we use a combination of phone calls, emails, and handwritten order forms. For CSA members, we have a sign-up sheet and a distribution schedule. At the farm stand, we rely on handwritten receipts and a cash register. This system can be quite chaotic, especially during peak season. Orders can get mixed up, and it's difficult to keep track of which items are selling the fastest."

**Ms. Jones:** "How do you communicate with your team about daily tasks and any changes in plans?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "We have daily team meetings in the morning, where we discuss the day's priorities and any urgent issues. We also use a whiteboard to post daily schedules and reminders. However, it can be difficult to keep everyone updated in real-time, especially if there are sudden changes to orders or delivery schedules."

**Ms. Jones:** "How do you currently analyze your sales data?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "We manually analyze our sales records at the end of each season to identify which crops were most profitable. This process is very time-consuming and doesn't provide us with real-time insights into sales trends. It would be helpful to have a system that could generate reports on sales by crop, customer, and sales channel."

**Ms. Jones:** "What are some of the biggest challenges you face in your current operations?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "As I mentioned, our manual systems can be quite inefficient. * **Inventory Tracking:** Keeping accurate inventory records is a constant struggle. * **Order Fulfillment:** Managing multiple sales channels can be overwhelming, especially during peak season. * **Communication:** Coordinating with our team, especially during busy periods, can be challenging. * **Data Analysis:** Analyzing sales data to identify trends and make informed decisions about planting and pricing is difficult with our current methods."

**Ms. Jones:** "How do you currently address these challenges?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "We rely heavily on spreadsheets and paper records. We've tried to improve our communication with team meetings and daily checklists, but it's still not always efficient. We're always looking for ways to streamline our operations and improve our productivity."

**Ms. Jones:** "Have you considered using any technology to help with these challenges?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "We've explored some basic accounting software, but nothing too sophisticated. We're a bit hesitant to invest in expensive technology without fully understanding the benefits."

**Ms. Jones:** "I understand. What are your goals for the future of Sunnyside Gardens?"

**Mr. Anderson:** "We want to continue to grow our business while maintaining our commitment to organic farming and providing our community with fresh, healthy food. We're also interested in exploring new markets and expanding our product offerings."

**Ms. Jones:** "Thank you for sharing your insights. I believe technology could play a significant role in helping you achieve your goals. I'll be sure to analyze the information you've provided and present you with some potential solutions."

**Mr. Anderson:** "Thank you, Ms. Jones. I appreciate you taking the time to understand our business. I look forward to hearing your recommendations."

**Ms. Jones:** "Thank you again for your time. Have a wonderful day."

**Mr. Anderson:** "You too."
