# Case Study 4: Enhancing Operations for “Grace in Motion Dance Studio”

[TOC]

This case study is presented in the form of a fictitious interview between a systems analyst and a business owner.

## Participants

- **Owner:** Emily Roberts, Owner and Director of Grace in Motion Dance Studio
- **Analyst:** Daniel Carter, Systems Analyst

## Interview Transcript

**Daniel:** Thanks for meeting with me, Emily. Can you tell me a little about Grace in Motion Dance Studio?

**Emily:** Sure! Grace in Motion has been around for about 10 years. We offer a variety of dance classes—ballet, jazz, hip-hop, contemporary, tap—you name it. Our classes are for all age groups, from toddlers to adults. We also put on a few public dance productions each year, which are a huge part of our identity and community engagement.

### Challenge 1: Class Scheduling and Enrollment

**Daniel:** What are some challenges you’re facing right now?

**Emily:** Scheduling and managing class enrollments can be tricky. We have a lot of different classes for different styles, skill levels, and age groups. We currently rely on spreadsheets and paper forms, which can get messy, especially during enrollment periods.

**Daniel:** How do you keep track of which classes are full or who’s signed up?

**Emily:** Manually, which is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. We’ve had cases where we accidentally overbooked a class or missed notifying someone about a waitlist spot opening.

### Challenge 2: Student and Family Communication

**Daniel:** How do you communicate with students and their families?

**Emily:** Mostly through email or phone calls. But sometimes information gets lost—like when we send reminders about class changes, costume fittings, or rehearsals. It’s also a hassle to manage contact lists for each class or production.

**Daniel:** Would you benefit from a system that centralizes communication and allows for targeted messaging?

**Emily:** Absolutely. It would save us a ton of time and make sure families get the right information.

### Challenge 3: Production and Ticket Sales

**Daniel:** Tell me about your dance productions. How do you handle ticket sales and production planning?

**Emily:** Productions are a huge part of what we do, but they’re also a logistical nightmare. Right now, we sell tickets manually—families come to the studio or call in, and we keep track of sales on a spreadsheet. It’s chaotic, especially as the show date approaches.

**Daniel:** That sounds time-consuming. How do you manage the production planning?

**Emily:** It’s a lot of juggling—assigning dancers to roles, scheduling rehearsals, coordinating with costume designers, and making sure parents are updated. Again, it’s mostly spreadsheets and emails.

### Challenge 4: Payments and Billing

**Daniel:** How do you handle payments for classes, costumes, and other fees?

**Emily:** Payments are made in-person or via checks. Some parents prefer paying in installments, and tracking those is a headache. Costume fees, in particular, can get messy when they’re not included in the tuition and families forget to pay on time.

**Daniel:** Would an automated billing and payment system help?

**Emily:** That would be a lifesaver, especially if it could send reminders and let parents pay online.

### Challenge 5: Marketing and Promotions

**Daniel:** How do you promote your classes and productions?

**Emily:** Mainly through social media and flyers around town. We have a website, but it’s outdated and doesn’t really help us showcase what we do.

**Daniel:** Would you like to upgrade your website to include class registration and ticket sales?

**Emily:** Yes, and it would be amazing to have a section where we can post photos, videos, and updates about productions and studio news.

### Challenge 6: Reporting and Analytics

**Daniel:** Do you have a way to track how your studio is performing—like class attendance, revenue, or ticket sales?

**Emily:** Not really. I’d love to have reports on those things, especially to see trends or identify which classes and productions are the most popular.
