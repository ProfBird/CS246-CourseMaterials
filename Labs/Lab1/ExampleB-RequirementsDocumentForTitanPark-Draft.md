## First Interview

**Case Study: Enhancing Volunteer Management for Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah**



**Participants:**

​	•	**Executive Director:** Emily Sanders, Interim Director of Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah

​	•	**Systems Analyst:** Mark Bradley



**Interview Transcript**



**Mark:** Thanks for meeting with me, Emily. Can you start by giving me an overview of the Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah?



**Emily:** Absolutely. We’re a non-profit organization focused on protecting and enhancing the ecosystems around Mt. Pisgah while supporting compatible recreation. We manage projects like trail maintenance, removing invasive species, and running a native plant nursery. We also host events and rely heavily on volunteers, donations, and community support to fulfill our mission.



**Mark:** That’s impressive. I understand you’re looking to improve how you manage volunteers. Could you explain your current challenges?



**Challenge 1: Volunteer Recruitment**



**Emily:** Sure. One of our biggest challenges is recruiting volunteers. Right now, we rely on word of mouth, social media, and occasional email campaigns to reach potential volunteers. It works to an extent, but we don’t have a centralized way to gather applications or match people with projects based on their interests.



**Mark:** So, a system that includes an online volunteer application form would help?



**Emily:** Definitely. If potential volunteers could fill out a form on our website, providing their contact information and the types of projects they’re interested in, it would save us a lot of back-and-forth communication.



**Challenge 2: Volunteer Scheduling**



**Mark:** Once someone signs up to volunteer, how do you handle scheduling?



**Emily:** Right now, it’s all manual. We maintain spreadsheets for each project and email or call volunteers to coordinate schedules. It’s time-consuming, and it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.



**Mark:** I can see how that could be frustrating. Would an online scheduling system where volunteers can see available times and sign up for specific slots be useful?



**Emily:** Yes, that would be amazing! It would allow volunteers to take more ownership of their schedules and reduce the administrative burden on our staff.



**Challenge 3: Volunteer Data Management**



**Mark:** How do you keep track of your volunteers and their contributions?



**Emily:** We have a basic database, but it’s outdated and not very user-friendly. It doesn’t integrate well with our website, so we often end up managing information across multiple systems. We need a way to centralize volunteer data, like contact information, project involvement, and schedules, in one place.



**Mark:** Would you also want administrative tools for staff to manage this data?



**Emily:** Absolutely. If we could access a database of volunteers and projects through a secure admin page, it would make our operations much smoother.



**Challenge 4: Promoting Events and Projects**



**Mark:** You also mentioned promoting events. How do you currently handle that?



**Emily:** Mostly through our website, social media, and email newsletters. It works, but it’s time-consuming to update everything manually. If we could integrate volunteer scheduling and project information into our event promotions, that would be a big help.



**Mark:** So, a system that dynamically updates project availability on the website and includes promotion tools would be ideal?



**Emily:** Exactly. The more streamlined, the better.



**Challenge 5: Fundraising and Support**



**Mark:** One last question—how does volunteer engagement tie into your fundraising efforts?



**Emily:** Our volunteers are also some of our most loyal supporters. Many of them become members, make donations, or encourage their employers to sponsor us. Having a better system to engage and track volunteers would help us strengthen those relationships and potentially grow our funding base.



**Proposed Solutions**



**Mark:** Based on what you’ve shared, here’s what I think we need:

​	1.	**Online Volunteer Application Form**

​	•	Collect contact information.

​	•	Allow volunteers to select projects of interest from a dynamically generated list.

​	2.	**Online Volunteer Scheduling System**

​	•	Display available times for work on various projects.

​	•	Allow volunteers to sign up for specific time slots.

​	3.	**Administrative Tools**

​	•	A secure database for staff to manage volunteer information, including contact details, project involvement, and schedules.

​	•	A database for managing and updating project details.

​	4.	**Event and Project Promotion Integration**

​	•	Dynamically display project schedules and volunteer opportunities on the website.

​	•	Enable easy updates to event and project information.

​	5.	**Future Expansion**

​	•	Integrate volunteer engagement data with fundraising tools to better track and engage supporters.



**Emily:** That all sounds perfect. How long do you think implementation would take?



**Mark:** With the right tools and a phased approach, we could have the core volunteer management features up and running in about three to four months.



**Emily:** That’s great. Let’s get started!



This interview outlines the foundational requirements for a volunteer management system that will enhance the operations and community engagement of Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah.

## Second Interview

**Simulated Second Interview: Deep Dive into Challenges at Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah**



**Participants:**

​	•	**Emily Sanders:** Interim Director of Friends of Buford Park & Mt. Pisgah

​	•	**Mark Bradley:** Systems Analyst



**Mark:** Thanks for sitting down with me again, Emily. After our first conversation, I wanted to dive deeper into some of the challenges you mentioned, so I can ensure the system we design fully addresses your needs.



**Emily:** Of course, I’m happy to provide more details.



**Challenge 1: Volunteer Recruitment**



**Mark:** In our last meeting, you mentioned wanting an online volunteer application form. Can you tell me more about what fields you’d want to include in that form?



**Emily:** Sure. At a minimum, we’d need their full name, email, phone number, and mailing address. We’d also want to ask if they have any specific skills or certifications—like chainsaw training or first aid—that might be useful for certain projects.



**Mark:** That makes sense. Would you also want to collect availability?



**Emily:** Yes, definitely. A section where they can indicate the days of the week and times they’re usually available would be great.



**Mark:** How about preferences for types of projects?



**Emily:** Yes. We’d like a dropdown or checklist with options like trail maintenance, invasive species removal, planting natives, nursery work, and event support.



**Challenge 2: Volunteer Scheduling**



**Mark:** Let’s talk more about scheduling. Right now, you’re using spreadsheets to manage volunteer shifts. How detailed does the schedule need to be?



**Emily:** It depends on the project. For something like trail maintenance, we might schedule volunteers for specific time slots—say, 9 a.m. to noon on a Saturday. But for the native plant nursery, it’s more flexible. Volunteers can drop in during open hours, so we just need a way to track how many people are planning to come on a given day.



**Mark:** So, the system would need to handle both fixed and flexible schedules?



**Emily:** Exactly. And it would be great if volunteers could see how many slots are still open for a given project so we can avoid overcrowding or understaffing.



**Challenge 3: Volunteer Data Management**



**Mark:** In terms of managing volunteer data, how do you currently track project participation?



**Emily:** We try to log hours manually after each project, but it’s not consistent. Ideally, the system could automatically track hours when volunteers check in and out or when they’re scheduled for a shift.



**Mark:** Would you want to generate reports based on those hours?



**Emily:** Yes, absolutely. We’d like to be able to recognize volunteers who reach certain milestones, like 50 or 100 hours. Those reports would also help us demonstrate our impact when we apply for grants.



**Mark:** Good point. Would you need any other details tied to volunteer records?



**Emily:** We’d like to track who’s completed specific training. For example, volunteers working with power tools need to attend a safety workshop, and we need to know who’s certified.



**Challenge 4: Event and Project Promotion**



**Mark:** For event and project promotion, you mentioned using your website and social media. How do you currently update your website?



**Emily:** Our website is managed through a content management system, but updates are manual. For example, when we have a new volunteer event, we have to create the event page and manually link to a signup form.



**Mark:** Would you prefer a system where events and volunteer opportunities automatically sync to the website?



**Emily:** That would be ideal. If we could create an event or project in the system and have it automatically generate a public-facing page with details and signup links, it would save us a lot of time.



**Mark:** Do you also want to include project updates or progress reports on the website?



**Emily:** Yes, that’s a great idea. Sharing updates about what we’ve accomplished could help engage the community and attract more volunteers.



**Challenge 5: Fundraising and Support**



**Mark:** Last time, you mentioned that many of your volunteers also become members or donors. How do you currently manage those relationships?



**Emily:** It’s very ad hoc. We send out a quarterly email asking volunteers to consider becoming members, but it’s not personalized.



**Mark:** Would it help to integrate your volunteer database with your fundraising system?



**Emily:** Definitely. If we could see who’s volunteered recently and send targeted emails thanking them for their work and suggesting ways to support us financially, that would be very effective.



**Mark:** Would you want to track which volunteers are already members or donors?



**Emily:** Yes, that would be useful. We could tailor our outreach to encourage them to increase their support or renew their membership.



**Challenge 6: Administrative Tools**



**Mark:** For the admin pages we discussed, how many staff members would need access to the system?



**Emily:** Probably five or six people. Each staff member manages different projects, so we’d need a way to assign access based on their roles. For example, the nursery manager doesn’t need to see trail maintenance schedules.



**Mark:** Understood. Would you also need audit logs to track changes, like who updated a volunteer record or modified a schedule?



**Emily:** That would be helpful, especially as we bring on new staff.



**Next Steps**



**Mark:** Thanks for all this additional information, Emily. It’s clear that the system needs to be flexible and user-friendly for both volunteers and staff. I’ll refine the requirements document based on this conversation.



**Emily:** Thank you, Mark. I’m excited to see what you come up with. Let me know if you need anything else.



**Mark:** Will do. I’ll be in touch soon.
