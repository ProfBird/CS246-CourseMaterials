# Assignment 8 - Domain Model

## Instructions

- Design a domain model for your client's web app by creating a UML class diagram.
- Create a new Git repository for your web app on GitHub.
- Create an ASP.NET MVC web app project in Visual Studio
  - Enable Identity in the project configuration, before you create the project, so that it automaically creates Identity user registration and login pages for you as well as adding a DbContext class and code for a database.
  - Put the new project in your Git repository

- Code the C# classes for the domain model.
- Create scaffolding to test key model classes.
  - For model classes that contain objects or collections of objects, add all the code to your model classes as well as the scaffolded controllers and views that you need to handle the *related data* (such as `.Include` statements when loading an object, or foreign keys on model classes, etc.)

This web app project is just a prototype. You will throw it away after it has been graded, but you will keep the domain model to use in the real project.


## Submission

- Upload a file containing your UML Diagram to Moodle as a PDF.
- Submit a link in the on-line text of the Moodle submission for the Git repository containing your scaffolded web app.
