# Assignment 6 - Team Contract and Requirements Doc

## Instructions

Both parts A and B will be done as a team with each member of the team contributing equally to the overall effort.

### Part A: Team Contract

Write a team contract based on the Team Contract Template posted on Moodle. As a team, you will need to discuss each point in the contract and decide your team policy for that point.

### Part B: Draft Requirements Document

Interview your client to find out what they need. Take notes as you do the interview and write a draft version of a requirements document based on the interview. You will be revising this document over the comeing weeks as you get more information from your client.

#### Meeting the Capstone Course Requirements

Note that the project you do for your client must also meet the minimum requirements for the capstone course project. But, this draft version of the requirements doesn't need to include everything required by the capstone. As you work with your clinet over the next few weeks, and you get a better understanding of their needs, you can suggest additional features that will meet the capstone course requirements.

## Submission

Submit your completed work on Moodle:

- Use the Lab 5A assignment link to submit your completed team contract.
- Use the Lab 5B assignment link to submit your requirements document.
  - In the online text, each team member will briefly list what they contributed to this assignment.
