# Assignment 5&mdash;Proposal and Contract



## Part 1: Proposal for a software development project

Use this example proposal given to you in class as a pattern and write a proposal for a software development project. Send this proposal to your client and get their response as to whether this reflects what they want.

## Part 2: Software development contract

Once you and the client have agreed on the scope of the work and the high level description of the project that you presented in your proposal; write a contract, sign it and send it to your client. The client may want to negotiate and revise some of the details of the contract before signing it&mdash;that's a normal part of the process.

### For Game Dev Students

Since you don't have an external client, I will fill the role of client. You can write the proposal for me and make the contract with me.

## Submission

As a group, submit the following to Moodle:

Word or PDF documents:
1. Your proposal
2. Your contract.
