# Assignment 5&mdash;Proposal and Contract



## Part 1: Proposal for a software development project

Use the example proposal given to you in class as a pattern and write a proposal for a software development project. Do not send this proposal to your client yet. After your instructor has read it and approved it, you will send it to your client to get feedback and possibly make revisions.

## Part 2: Software development contract

Write a contract, based on the example given to you in class, but don't send it to your client yet. Submit it for review by your instructor.

Once your instructor has approved the contract, and you and the client have agreed on the scope of the work and the high level description of the project that you presented in your proposal; sign the contract and send it to your client. The client may want to negotiate and revise some of the details of the contract before signing it&mdash;that's a normal part of the process.

## Submission

One person in your group will submit the following to Moodle on behalf of the group:

Word or PDF documents:
1. An initial software development proposal that you will review with your client after it has been approved by your instructor.
2. An initial contract that you will present to your client after it has been approved by your instructor.  The contract will include the revised version of your proposal.
3. The final, signed version of the contract.
