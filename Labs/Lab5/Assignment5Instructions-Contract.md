# Assignment 5&mdash;Proposal and Contract



## Part 1: Proposal for a software development project

Use the example proposal given to you in class as a pattern and write a proposal for a software development project. Do not send this proposal to your client yet. After your instructor has read it and approved it, you will send it to your client to get feedback and possibly make revisions.

## Part 2: Software development contract

Write a contract, based on the one given to you in class, but don't send it to your client yet. Submit it for review by your instructor.

Once your instructor has approved the contract, and you and the client have agreed on the scope of the work and the high level description of the project that you presented in your proposal; sign the contract and send it to your client. The client may want to negotiate and revise some of the details of the contract before signing it&mdash;that's a normal part of the process.

### For Game Dev Students

Since you don't have an external client, I will fill the role of client. You can write the proposal for me and make the contract with me.

## Submission

As a group, submit the following to Moodle:

Word or PDF documents:
1. A draft of the software development proposal that you will review with your client after it has been approved by your instructor.
2. A draft of the contract that you will present to your client after it has been approved by your instructor.  The contract will include the final version of your proposal, which will include revisions made after reviewing it with your client.
